# SPLS Data

The Scottish Programming Languages Seminar is an informal meeting for programming languages researchers across Scotland. It's been running for a while now (13 years!), and I thought it'd be interesting to take a look more closely.

I have managed to get hold of data for all but one of the SPLS meetings (the Tuesday 26th October 2005 meeting in Strathclyde). There were some dead links on the SPLS page: the 16th June 2010 and 1st February 2006 URLs were fixable by moving to the new St Andrews webpage syntax; the 14th June 2007 page was accessible on http://www.archive.org, and Bob Atkey still had a copy of the 14th January 2009 meeting (8 years later!)

I have given institutions class codes:
  * University of St Andrews -- StA
  * Heriot-Watt University -- HW
  * University of Edinbugh -- ED
  * University of Strathclyde -- SC
  * University of Dundee -- DD
  * University of the West of Scotland -- UWS
  * University of Glasgow -- GL

Currently, speakers from outwith these institutions are marked as "O" (for "other") -- but I might go back and give these more fine-grained locations later on.

A few notes:
  * Data retrieved from the websites of past SPLS talks. Most of these accessible from http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/research/spls/.
  * "institution" for speakers refers to the speaker's institution when they gave the talk
  * I have normalised some of the names, preferring unshortened ("Philip Wadler" instead of "Phil Wadler", for example). Although I may not have got them all!
  * For talks where multiple speakers were listed, I have taken the first name as the speaker.
